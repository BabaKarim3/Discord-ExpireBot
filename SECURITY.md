## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do NOT report security problems publically. Do NOT use issues, use the Security Tab.<br>
Alternatively you can DM me via Twitter (@hxr404) or Discord (hxr404#5022).<br>
If you can't reach me, you can open an issue and contact the mods on my Discord Server or use any other way to comunicate, but WITHOUT wrinting what the security problem is.
I will then tell you, where we can talk safely.
