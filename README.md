# Discord-ExpireBot

This Bot allows you to let roles expire. If you set e.g. the @voted role to 12h, the role will get removed automatically 12h after obtaining. This is individual to all users on the guild. It also saves the obtaining time into a JSON File, so if the Bot gets temporary offline, it can handle this.

I didn't code it all on myself, I only helped and send feedback/did testing etc. The original Creator wants to stay private, so we decided to make the bot my own.
I'll probably host the bot and make it public for top.gg so anyone can use it, and I'll add multi-guild functuallity. The more complicated features will be coded by my friend (my Python knowledge is very limited)
